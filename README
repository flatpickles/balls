Balls!

Everyone loves balls, so I made them dance. Mostly a fun mini-project & evaluation of PhysicsJS for browser-based 2D physics rendering (result: "not bad!"), but fun to play with nonetheless.

Included in this repo are jquery.min.js and physicsjs-full-0.6.0.min.js. Needless to say, I did not create these wonderful things.

P.S. I'm well aware that this project includes a handful of rectangles as well â€“ gasp! I choose not to emphasize the lesser aspects of my doings. Balls 4 lyfe.
